# Step 1

``` shell
make
```
# Step 2 
Tests begin with number 1 will make the semantic checking, such as test10.txt.


Tests from test10 to test14 are the incorrect programs.

Tests from test15 to test19 are the corresponding correct program versions.

```shell
./comp < test0.txt
./comp < test1.txt
./comp < test2.txt
```
Incorrect Sample.
```shell
./comp < test3.txt
```
Our code will report "syntax error" and skip the AST generation process.
